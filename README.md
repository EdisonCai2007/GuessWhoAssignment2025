## 📝 Description
This project is a digital recreation of the classic **Guess Who** board game, developed in Java as a final assignment for the ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science) course. Our goal was to create a GUI-based software product that emulates the *Guess Who* board game. In this game, two players guess each other’s characters by asking a series of yes-or-no questions. The program features a clean, intuitive GUI with buttons that guide the player through the game.
